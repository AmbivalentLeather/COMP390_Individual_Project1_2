What mode would you like to open the file with?
"r" - open for reading (default)
"w" - open for writing, truncating the file first (WARNING: This will delete
        the contents of an existing file!)
"x" - open for exclusive creation, failing if the file already exists
"a" - open for writing, appending to the end of file if it exists
Enter ">q" or ">Q" to quit
